    "Our calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT) using the PBE functional as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). The interaction between the valence electrons and ionic cores is described within the projector augmented (PAW) approach with a plane‐wave energy cutoff of 500 eV. Spin polarization was included for all the calculations. The monolayer of MoS<sub>2</sub> and defects calculations were performed using an 8x8 supercell, and the Brillouin zone was sampled using a (3x3x1) Monkhorst‐Pack grid. We use periodic boundary conditions, and add a 15Å vacuum space above the material surface to avoid interaction between neighboring layers. In the structural energy minimization, the atomic coordinates are allowed to relax until the forces on all the atoms are less than 0.01 eV/Å. The energy tolerance is $10^{-6}$ eV. \n",
